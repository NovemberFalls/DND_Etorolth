## History
### Warden's Tale 
#### Awakening 

Warden's consciousness emerged gradually in an ancient library, triggered by the resonance between magical relics and the runes etched into his stone form. Unlike the dramatic awakenings often depicted in stories, his came as a slow revelation - a gradual lifting of fog that brought both awareness and questions.

- Successfully broke free from the Keeper's control

### The Pursuit
